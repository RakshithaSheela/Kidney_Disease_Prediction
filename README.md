Project Title: 
Kidney Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

Objective:
To develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts whether a person has chronic kidney disease (CKD) or not, based on clinical features such as age, BMI, lifestyle habits, blood pressure, and lab test values.

Algorithms Used:
1.Logistic Regression
2.Support Vector Machine (SVM â€“ RBF)
3.Decision Tree Classifier
4.Random Forest Classifier
5.K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
6.Lasso Regression
7.Ridge Regression

Accuracy Results (Based on Confusion Matrix):
Algorithm	Accuracy (%)
1.Logistic Regression	91.97%
2.SVM (RBF)	91.37%
3.Random Forest	91.57%
4.K-Nearest Neighbors	91.16%
5.Decision Tree	86.95%
6.Lasso Regression	91.37%
7.Ridge Regression	91.37%

Dataset Used:
File: Chronic_Kidney_Dsease_data.csv
Features: Age, Gender, Ethnicity, BMI, Smoking, Alcohol Consumption, Medical Checkups, Itching, Water Quality, etc.
Target Variable: Diagnosis (1 = CKD, 0 = No CKD)
